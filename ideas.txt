## Amazon affiliate deal alerts for creators (storage niche)
- Target: UK creators / content creators (overlap with motorbike YouTube audience)
- Niche: high-demand tech items, especially storage: SSDs (NVMe/SATA), RAM, SD cards, enclosures
- Value prop: low-frequency email list (“only when it’s actually a good price”) with Amazon referral links
- Key needs:
  - durable price data source (avoid fragile scraping if possible; consider PA-API/Keepa/CamelCamelCamel)
  - landing page + email signup + welcome sequence
  - distribution via YouTube: description (top), pinned comment, verbal CTA

## Product price finder / comparison helper
- Problem: find a product online and quickly see if it’s cheaper elsewhere (Google, price comparison sites, image search)
- User flow (MVP): paste a product URL (or title) → get a shortlist of alternative retailers + best-effort prices + links
- Constraints:
  - avoid paid APIs; prefer free sources / low-frequency crawling
  - matching is tricky (variants/bundles); include confidence notes
- Possible sources (UK): PriceRunner, PriceSpy, Idealo, Google Shopping (may be brittle), Amazon/eBay search pages
- Output: “best total price including shipping” if possible; otherwise just price + link + retailer
