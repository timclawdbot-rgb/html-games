## Amazon affiliate deal alerts for creators (storage niche)
- Target: UK creators / content creators (overlap with motorbike YouTube audience)
- Niche: high-demand tech items, especially storage: SSDs (NVMe/SATA), RAM, SD cards, enclosures
- Value prop: low-frequency email list (“only when it’s actually a good price”) with Amazon referral links
- Key needs:
  - durable price data source (avoid fragile scraping if possible; consider PA-API/Keepa/CamelCamelCamel)
  - landing page + email signup + welcome sequence
  - distribution via YouTube: description (top), pinned comment, verbal CTA

## Product price finder / comparison helper
- Problem: find a product online and quickly see if it’s cheaper elsewhere (Google, price comparison sites, image search)
- User flow (MVP): paste a product URL (or title) → get a shortlist of alternative retailers + best-effort prices + links
- Constraints:
  - avoid paid APIs; prefer free sources / low-frequency crawling
  - matching is tricky (variants/bundles); include confidence notes
- Possible sources (UK): PriceRunner, PriceSpy, Idealo, Google Shopping (may be brittle), Amazon/eBay search pages
- Output: “best total price including shipping” if possible; otherwise just price + link + retailer

## Pivot 7sweb.com from "websites" to "automation & systems" for local businesses
- Observation: brochure websites are commoditised (Squarespace/Wix/WordPress), but businesses still pay for outcomes: saved time, fewer mistakes, more leads.
- Angle/credibility: Tim automated ~2 weeks of testing done by 8 people at a payroll company (click-through + compare vs expected results).
- Productised offers (repeatable packages):
  - Lead capture + instant follow-up + CRM/Sheet + reminders
  - Booking + calendar + reminders + intake form (reduce no-shows)
  - Invoicing + payment chasing + weekly summaries
- Site changes:
  - Headline: "Automations for local businesses — save 5–20 hours/week" (websites as add-on)
  - CTA: "Free 20-min automation audit" + simple fixed-price packages + monthly support
